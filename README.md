## Description:

Medieinstitutet Assignment for beginner Javascript course. The task was to create a one page webside for a webstore using HTML, Sass & Javascript.

The site allows you to view and select which garden gnomes to buy, you can also go through a form that is validated to "send" the order. The form doesn't send the data anywhere since it's not an actual store. As the focus was on learning Javascript, I kept the CSS layout simple to put my focus on Javascript.
